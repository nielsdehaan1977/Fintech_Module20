# This project uses a solidity smart contract to that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## This solidity smart contract is a start to build and automate many of the institutionsâ€™ financial processes and features, such as in this case hosting joint savings accounts.

* The solidity smart contract goest through the following steps:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2. Compile and Deploy Smart Cotnract in Remix VM (London) (I've used Remix VM London as JavaScript VM was not available anymore)
3. Interact with the deployed smart contract

## Tech

This project leverages [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

* The solidity language is used to program a solidity smart contract to function on the ethereum blockchain
* Remix IDE is a web application used to build solidity smart contracts and provides the ability to test the smart contract in a virtual test environment.

## Usage

To use the joint savings smart contract, simply clone the full repository and open the **joint_savings.sol** file in Remix IDE.

The tool will go through the following steps:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity



2. Compile and Deploy Smart Cotnract in Remix VM (London) (I've used Remix VM London as JavaScript VM was not available anymore)





3. Interact with the deployed smart contract
