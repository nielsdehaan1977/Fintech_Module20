# This project uses a solidity smart contract to that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

---
## This solidity smart contract is a start to build and automate many of the institutionsâ€™ financial processes and features, such as in this case hosting joint savings accounts.

* The solidity smart contract goest through the following steps:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2. Compile and Deploy Smart Cotnract in Remix VM (London) (I've used Remix VM London as JavaScript VM was not available anymore)
3. Interact with the deployed smart contract

## Installation Guide

### Before running the application first install the following dependencies in either Gitbash or Terminal. (If not already installed)

#### Step1: Activate dev environment in Gitbash or Terminal to do so type:
```python
    conda activate dev
```
#### Step2: install the following libraries (if not installed yet) by typing:
```python
    pip install streamlit
    pip install web3==5.17
    pip install mnemonic
    pip install bip44
    

 ```
#### Step3: Start python file with RUN Streamlit
Streamlit can be started by:
1. Activate your developer environment in Terminal or Git Bash (already done in step 1)
2. Form the location where you cloned the github repository folder, type: ***Streamlit run fintech_finder.py***

## Usage

To use the fintech_finder app, simply clone the full repository and open the **fintech_finder.py** file in via streamlit from your gitbash or terminal by using Step3 in above installation guide. 

The tool will go through the following steps:

* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache
